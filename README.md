Climate Change Impact Dashboard
This project delivers an interactive dashboard analyzing climate change impacts across 10 globally significant countries from 1990 to 2023. The dashboard combines critical environmental indicators—greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation rates, and temperature anomalies—to provide a comprehensive view of each country’s contribution and vulnerability to climate change.

Features
Data Integration: Cleaned and merged multi-year datasets using Python, sourced from Our World in Data.

Interactive Visualizations: Power BI dashboards featuring choropleth maps, trend lines, bar charts, and KPI cards for country-wise and temporal analysis.

Filtering and Benchmarking: Users can filter data by country, year, and metric to explore trends and compare performance.

Insightful Metrics: Highlights top CO₂ emitters, regions with severe forest loss, and areas experiencing significant temperature rise.

Policy Relevance: Supports evaluation of climate commitments and progress through data-driven insights.

Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy) for data preprocessing and feature engineering

Power BI for interactive data visualization and dashboard design

Our World in Data open climate datasets as the primary data source
